## Steps

### Create the data lake

In the AWS Lake Formation console, in the left navigation pane, choose Register and ingest, Data lake locations. Select a single S3 bucket to house several independent data sources in your data lake.

### Add data to your data lake
Now that you have an S3 bucket configured as a storage resource for Lake Formation, you must add data to your data lake. You can add data to your data lakeâ€™s S3 bucket storage resource using AWS SDKs, AWS CLI, the S3 console, or a Lake Formation blueprint.

With Lake Formation, you can discover and set up the ingestion of your source data. When you add a workflow that loads or updates the data lake, you can choose a blueprint or template of the type of importer to add. Lake Formation provides several blueprints on the Lake Formation console for common source data types to simplify the creation of workflows. Workflows point to your data source and target and specify the frequency that they run.
